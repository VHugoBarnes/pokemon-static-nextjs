This is a Next.js project to learn about [Static Site Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load "Inter", a custom Google Font.
